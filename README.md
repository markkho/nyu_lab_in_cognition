# NYU Lab in Cognition (+ Perception or what have you)

## Overview

NYU Psychology department recently has begun to roll out a new approach to laboratory classes in
psychology.  One aspect of this new approach is the use of Jupyter notebooks to help provide
interesting and interactive "hands-on" type learning tasks.  This repository includes
the notebooks, quizzes, exams, and laboratory units that make up these labs.  They are available
open source so that other instructors can use these materials and hopefully even contribute to them
via git pull requests!

## Set up

To build the book, from the root directory:
```bash
$ cd book
$ make book
```

To deploy, from the root directory:
```bash
$ cd book
$ make deploy
```
Note that this force commits to a `gh-pages` branch on the repo with the compiled
book contents.
