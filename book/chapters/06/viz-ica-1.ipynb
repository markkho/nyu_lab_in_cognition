    "This lab focuses on creating plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a general purpose library for creating various kinds of visualizations in Python, including static, animated, and even interactive plots. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a Python library that provides utilities for plotting and visualizing data and uses Matplotlib under the hood. For most purposes, seaborn is sufficient, but when we need more detailed control over our plots, we will turn to Matplotlib.\n"
