# Schedule for Section 3

This is the schedule for the semester. This page will be frequently updated
based on how we progress and everything is subject to change. Homeworks and
links to the lecture will be provided here for easy reference to the calendar.
The assignments refer to the homework **following** a class meeting. So if on
a particular date it says watch a video, that is for next time!
